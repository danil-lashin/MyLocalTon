/**
 * Block header. Another non-split component of a shardchain block
 * is the block header, which contains general information such as (w, s) (i.e.,
 * the workchain_id and the common binary prefix of all account_ids assigned
 * to the current shardchain), the blockâ€™s sequence number (defined to be the
 * smallest non-negative integer larger than the sequence numbers of its predecessors),
 * logical time, and generation unixtime. It also contains the hash of
 * the immediate antecessor of the block (or of its two immediate antecessors
 * in the case of a preceding shardchain merge event), the hashes of its initial
 * and final states (i.e., of the states of the shardchain immediately before and
 * immediately after processing the current block), and the hash of the most
 * recent masterchain block known when the shardchain block was generated.
